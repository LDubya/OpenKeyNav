# OpenKeyNav

OpenKeyNav is an open-source JavaScript library designed to enhance keyboard accessibility on websites. Originally developed to improve the keyboard accessibility of the best-selling [Columns](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/columns-two-column-notes/id1493839821) app, it generates keyboard shortcuts on the fly and presents them to users on-demand, supporting complex interactions like drag-and-drop entirely with the keyboard.

OpenKeyNav is available for developers to fork, modify, and use via its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LDubya/OpenKeyNav) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openkeynav).

## Read the preprint

The creator of OpenKeyNav, who is also a researcher at Harvard Medical School (*), 
introduces the methodology behind his tool in the preprint 
*"Using OpenKeyNav to Enhance the Keyboard-Accessibility of Web-based Data Visualization Tools"* [(OSF Preprint)](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/3wjsa). 
This paper will be presented at the AccessViz workshop, part of IEEE VIS 2024 conference.

## Features

- **Automatic Keyboard Shortcuts**: Generate and display keyboard shortcuts dynamically.
- **Complex Interactions**: Support for keyboard-based drag-and-drop and other complex interactions.
- **Customizable Activation Keys**: Configure different keys to trigger various behaviors.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Identify and highlight elements that are not accessible via screen readers.
- **Empowerment Intervention**: Enable users to navigate and interact with web content using their keyboards despite existing accessibility barriers.

## Installation

Basic installation and setup instructions are below. For detailed documentation, guides, and tutorials, visit the [OpenKeyNav Documentation](https://openkeynav.github.io).


To install OpenKeyNav, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install openkeynav
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use OpenKeyNav in your project:



#### Installing via NPM

To install OpenKeyNav&trade; using npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install openkeynav
```

Then, you can import and use it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import OpenKeyNav from 'openkeynav';

const openKeyNav = new OpenKeyNav();
// initialize with default settings
openKeyNav.init();
```

#### Including the Script from a CDN

If you prefer not to use npm, you can include OpenKeyNav directly from a CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/openkeynav/dist/openkeynav.umd.min.js"></script>
```

After including the script, you can initialize OpenKeyNav like this:

```html
<script>
  const openKeyNav = new OpenKeyNav();
  // initialize with default settings
  openKeyNav.init();
</script>
```
#### Initiating in a React app

To use in a React app, initiate in the main component (e.g., App or its equivalent):

For functional components:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import OpenKeyNav from 'openkeynav';

const App = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const openKeyNav = new OpenKeyNav();
        openKeyNav.init();
    }, []);

    // ...
};

export default App;
```

For class components:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import OpenKeyNav from 'openkeynav';

class App extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        const openKeyNav = new OpenKeyNav();
        openKeyNav.init();
    }

    // ...
}

export default App;
```

### Key Commands

- **Click Mode**: Press `k` to enter click mode, which labels clickable elements with keyboard shortcuts. Press the key combinations on the labels to "click" their respective buttons.
- **Heading Navigation**: Press `h` to navigate through headers within the viewport. Press `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`, or `6` to navigate through headers of the respective level.
- **Scroll Navigation**: Press `s` to cycle through different scrollable regions within the viewport.
- **Drag-and-Drop Mode**: Press `m` to enter drag mode, which enables keyboard-accessible drag-and-drop by labeling pre-configured draggable elements with keyboard shortcuts, and then the selected draggable element's applicable drop zones. See [To customize drag-and-drop](#to-customize-draganddrop).

### Disabling Debug Mode for Production

By default, OpenKeyNav initiates in debug mode, which adds red labels to elements that are mouse-clickable but not tab-focusable. These elements are not WCAG-compliant, since they are not keyboard accessible. The elements with black labels are keyboard accessible. This enables you to identify the elements that need remediation.

It is recommended to keep debug mode turned on while developing and to remediate any keyboard access barriers that you find in this mode.

However, you should not present debug mode to your end users. Therefore, when you are ready to go into production, make sure to disable the debug mode:

```javascript
openKeyNav.init({
    ...
    debug: {
        keyboardAccessible: false // set this to false when done debugging inaccessible keyboard elements.
    }
});
```

### To Customize Drag-and-Drop:

```javascript
// Example drag-and-drop configuration
const moveConfig = [
  {
    fromContainer: ".containerOfMoveables",
    toElements: ".dropZoneTargetType1, .dropZoneTargetType2",
    callback: (elMoveable, elDropZoneTarget) => {
      // Your callback logic
    }
  },
  {
    fromContainer: ".classFrom2",
    toElements: ".classToB"
  },
  {
    fromContainer: ".classFrom3",
    toElements: ".classToC"
  }
];

// Initialize with configuration
openKeyNav.init({
    modesConfig: {
        move: {
            config: moveConfig
        }
    }
});
```

### Customization

You can override these default settings to suit your needs:

```javascript
const config = {
    spot: {
        fontColor: 'white',
        backgroundColor: '#333',
        insetColor: '#000',
        fontSize: 'inherit',
        arrowSize_px: 4
    },
    focus: {
        outlineColor: '#0088cc',
        outlineStyle: 'solid'
    },
    keys: {
        escape: 'q', // alternative escape key, for when escape key is too far or not available. // q works great because top left of letters, plus removes confusion with g, p
        click: 'k', // enter click mode, to click on clickable elements, such as links. Was g, now k, for kanga. Plus NVDA uses k to focus on link elements, which prevents conflicting modes as it's either openkeynav or NVDA.
        scroll: 's', // focus on the next scrollable region
        move: 'm', // enter move mode, to move elements from and to, aka keyboard drag and drop
        heading: 'h', // focus on the next heading // as seen in JAWS, NVDA
    }
};

const openKeyNav = new OpenKeyNav();
openKeyNav.init(config);
```
